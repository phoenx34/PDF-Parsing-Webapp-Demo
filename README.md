# PDF Parsing web-app demo
Our pdf analysis tool for HackISU 2016. 

## About
  This is a simple demo that can be deployed to a local host apache server. It parses a given PDF and uses Regex to extract informtion containing dates. Those dates (with the appropriate information) are then outputted to the user in what is now a simple text file. The idea is that this can be used to take a given syllabus for a course, and get assignment due dates, test dates, quizzes, etc and then give this information back to the user in a useful format. 
  
  
## To-Do
- [ ] Tidying up the output and improving the regex scanning and parsing. 
- [ ] Integrating the Google Calendar API to sync outputted dates with a given user's google account
- [ ] Finish up the Website, and deploy it to a proper, public url
- [ ] Bug fixes and maintenance
